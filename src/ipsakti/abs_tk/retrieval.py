"""Member 4 Phase 1 — minimal deterministic retrieval seam over the ABS/TK corpus.

Deliberately simple (MEMBER_4.md section 6): token/keyword scoring over the
curated records. No vector database, no rerankers, no LLM, no network.

Behaviour:
- A query is tokenised (lowercase, stopwords removed).
- A record's score is the sum, over distinct query tokens, of the token's
  strongest field hit (keywords x3, section x2, source_name x2, excerpt x1,
  scope x1). Field echoes of the same word do not stack.
- A token matches when one is a prefix of the other with at least
  MIN_PREFIX_LEN characters (light morphology: plant~plants,
  commercialise~commercialisation).
- A query is only eligible for ABS/TK evidence if it contains at least one
  token from the ABS/TK domain lexicon (DOMAIN_LEXICON). This keeps clearly
  unrelated queries (e.g. trademark-only) from ever being answered here.
- Records with score below MIN_SCORE are not returned; a query whose best
  score is below the threshold yields no evidence (Phase 2 abstains on that
  basis). All scoring is deterministic; ties are broken by record id.
