"""Domain-routing decision for the central assistant (MEMBER_1.md §1, §3).

The assistant's flow is: intent/context → decide which specialised domain is
relevant → evidence retrieval → grounded answer. This module owns the
"decide which specialized domain is relevant" step as a clean, swappable seam:

- Phase 1 (standalone): `route()` classifies the query into a specialist
  domain with a simple, transparent keyword heuristic. No specialist is
  registered, so `assistant.handle_query` may answer from M1's own standalone
  corpus for independent dev/demo purposes.
- At integration: M6 registers the real specialists (M2 classification,
  M3 India, M4 ABS/TK, M5 International) via `register_specialist` and flips
  `Config.specialists_wired`. The corpus-safety rule then applies: a query
  routed to a specialist domain whose specialist is unavailable must abstain,
  never silently answer from M1's demo corpus.

# Routing signals (M6 Phase 4, routing-intent fix). The original flat
# ABS_TK_SIGNALS list sent ANY query containing "traditional knowledge"/"tkdl"
# to the ABS/TK specialist even when the query's intent was patentability
# (e.g. "Can traditional knowledge documented in TKDL affect the
# patentability of my invention in India?"), which M3 — the India-IP
# specialist that owns the Section 3(p)/2(1)(j) analysis and carries the
# legitimate TKDL pointer — never saw. The lists are now split by intent:
#
#   ABS_DOMAIN_SIGNALS   genuine access-and-benefit-sharing / biological-
#                        resource matters (M4's documented domain; a query
#                        naming a biological resource AND a patent is a real
#                        ABS/IPR intersection and stays here — MEMBER_4.md);
#   TK_AWARENESS_SIGNALS traditional-knowledge/TKDL awareness — routes to M4
#                        ONLY when no patentability intent is present, so
#                        ordinary TK questions still reach M4;
#   PATENT_INTENT_SIGNALS patentability intent — with TK awareness present,
#                        the query falls through to the jurisdiction toggle:
#                        India → M3 (which answers with the TKDL pointer),
#                        International → M5 (WIPO GRATK disclosure route).
