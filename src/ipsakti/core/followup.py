"""Conversational follow-up handling (Phase 3, MEMBER_1.md "Phase 3").

Follow-up questions are typically short and elliptical ("What about outside
India?", "And the TKDL angle?") and retrieve poorly on their own. This module
builds the effective retrieval query for the assistant flow:

- A self-contained query (more than MAX_SELF_CONTAINED_TOKENS content tokens,
  or no history) is used unchanged.
- A short query with conversation history is enriched with the content of the
  most recent user turn, so retrieval can find the evidence the conversation
  is about. The original query text is always kept at the end so its own
  tokens still count.

Grounding is unaffected: the expanded query is used only for retrieval; the
answer is still generated exclusively from the retrieved evidence, and the
LLM prompt continues to show the real question plus the history (see
generation.build_messages). Jurisdiction filtering is unaffected — the
explicit India/International toggle always wins.
